# NCAA_MetricProject
An ongoing attempt to build a “catch-all” performance metric for college basketball players. One that accounts for the quirks of NCAA play (conference strength, pace differences, usage, etc.) instead of just copy-pasting NBA formulas. 

The goal isn’t perfection (at least not yet), just aiming to:

- Track my development as an analyst (data wrangling and visualizations).

- Experiment with how much context matters. For example: conference dynamics, tempo/style differences, and why college hoops ≠ (W)NBA hoops.

- Build a framework to iterate on each season until it’s sharp enough to compare players across conferences.
